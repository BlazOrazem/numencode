# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This package has no LTS releases - this means that we will only support the latest minor release with feature updates.

We will do our best to fix security issues and inform all users about possible issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Because security vulnerabilities could harm users we please you to don't use the public issue tracker to report them.
Please write an email to [info@numencode.com](mailto:info@numencode.com).
Depending on the kind of issue we will create a public issue/security alert or fix it and inform afterwards.
